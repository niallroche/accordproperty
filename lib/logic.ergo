buyer must be granted access before completion to check property, possibly multiple times by agreement, 
if this was not allowed it could be a reason for compensation

compensation couldbe reasonable expenses related to non-vacation or issues moving in (due to damage???)
hotel expenses, moving and stroage fees etc. this needs to be paid less and per day compensation that is specified in the contract as an per day interest payment
